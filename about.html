<p>The founders of Black Cat Sound System are two best friends who grew up together in Fort Lauderdale, FL and share the same inspiration and passion for music. 
    Luis Fernandez, also known as Graphyte, is a 24 year old producer and DJ who is inspired by the music scene and sound system culture.
    Andrew Nelson, also known as Druiid, is a 24 year old music engineering student, DJ, and producer who is inspired by music history. 
    <span id="druiid">"We have a passion for high quality audio and music history, so we are paying homage to how the whole scene got started. 
    All of the electronic music we listen to today is derivative of old school dubstep when Jamaicans started to make a shift from analog to digital 
    and they used to have sound clashes which are big battles where they would play on vinyl and handmade speakers trying to acheive a louder or better sound 
    to battle the opponent."-Druiid</span> <span id="graphyte">"We hope to bring sound system culture and high 
    fidelity audio to South Florida where is happens to be scarce."-Graphyte</span></p>
